# Syncora

A platform to watch videos with your guild, using local or remote files.

## Disclaimer

This project is currently under development.

## Features

Syncora allows you to be in multiple guilds with different groups of friends, where you can stream,
play a local file or load and play a video from a torrent file ([please read the disclaimer](#important-disclaimer)).

For those who have worse internet conditions, you may simply have everyone download the video file before 
watching and use the **Local Stream** functionality.

If internet speed is not a problem, **Live Stream** can be used. Alternatively, in some scenarios, some
users may find it faster to stream using **Torrent Stream**, to avoid relying on a single provider for
better speeds.

## Important Disclaimer

Syncora provides functionality that allows synchronized viewing of video content through:
- Local synchronization: Playing video files stored locally on each userâ€™s device without uploading.
- Uploaded file streaming: Streaming of video files explicitly uploaded by users.
- Torrent streaming: Streaming video content directly from torrent files.

These features are intended solely for personal, legal use.

By using Syncora, you explicitly agree not to play, stream, upload, or share copyrighted, pirated, or
illegally-obtained media. You must ensure that:
- You legally own or have explicit permission to use the content.
- The content is in the public domain or explicitly licensed for personal use.

Syncora does not host, distribute, or encourage distribution of unauthorized or pirated material. Users are solely responsible and liable for any misuse, copyright infringement, piracy, or unauthorized distribution.

Syncora and its developers or contributors disclaim all responsibility and liability for illegal or unauthorized use of these features.
